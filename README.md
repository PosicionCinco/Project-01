# Project-01
Responsive Multipage Education/University Website using (HTML, CSS, & JavaScript)

- NOTE FOR MY SELF:

- Embarking on this project will equip me with a comprehensive skill set for crafting dynamic and customizable websites. Leveraging the versatility of "CSS Variables," I'll seamlessly tailor the website's appearance. The strategic application of "CSS Grid & Flexbox" will 
   ensure easy alignment, while the adoption of BEM (Block Element Modifier) principles will streamline class naming conventions for clarity and maintainability.

- In pursuit of responsive design, I'll employ various CSS units like viewport height (vh), viewport width (vw), fractions (fr), and percentages (%). Enhancing user interaction, I'll implement "CSS Transitions & Animations" using keyframes for a polished and engaging 
   website experience. For dynamic slides in the testimonial section, the integration of "Swiper.JS" will add a professional touch.

- Moreover, the website's form submission functionality, fortified with spam protection and devoid of backend language, will allow users to seamlessly send emails. The integration of "CSS Media Queries" will ensure a responsive design tailored to different breakpoints and 
   screen sizes, providing a cohesive and user-friendly experience across devices. By the project's end, I'll possess the skills to craft websites that not only look sleek and modern but also boast optimal customization and responsiveness.
